// id=datadog-label

The `Kube_cluster_name` label does not show in Kloudfuse stack when MELT data ingested from Datadog agent is missing the `kube_cluster_name` label.

A known issue in the Datadog agent cluster name detection requires that the cluster agent be up. If the dd-agent starts before the cluster agent, it fails to detect the cluster name. See Datadog https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/issues/24406[Issue #24406^].

Resolution::

Perform a rollout restart of the Datadog agent daemonset:
+
[,console]
----
kubectl rollout restart daemonset datadog-agent
----
