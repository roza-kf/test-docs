A non-admin (SSO) user may get one of these permission errors when creating an alert or a contact point:

[,console]
----
{"accessErrorId":"ACE0947587429","message":"You'll need additional permissions to perform this action. Permissions needed: any of alert.notifications:write","title":"Access denied"}

{"accessErrorId":"ACE3104889351","message":"You'll need additional permissions to perform this action. Permissions needed: any of alert.provisioning:read, alert.provisioning.secrets:read","title":"Access denied"}
----

This is because the user may not have the permissions to create contact points or alerts manually. 

Resolution::
. Log in as an admin user.
. Create a contact point or an alert.
