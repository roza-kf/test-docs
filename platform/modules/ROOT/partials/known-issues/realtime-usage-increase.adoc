// id=realtime-usage-increase

The `pinot-server-realtime` persistent volume usage keeps increasing when there is a disconnect in segment movement.

This has been partially fixed in Kloudfuse Release 2.6.5.

Two methods to verify the behaviour:

- In Release 2.6.5 and later versions, Kloudfuse issues an automatic alert when PVC usage exceeds 40%.

- Navigate to *Kloudfuse Overview â†’ System dashboards*. In the *PV Used Space* panel, check the graph for `pinot-server-realtime`.

Resolution::
. Restart the `pinot-realtime` and `pinot-offline` servers:
+
[,console]
----
kubectl rollout restart sts pinot-server-offline pinot-server-realtime
----

. If PV usage already reached 100% and cannot be restarted gracefully, you must increase the PVC size of `pinot-realtime` PVCs by approximately 10% to accommodate the increased requirements, and then restart the `pinot-server offline` and `pinot-server realtime`.
