Cardinality is important for the following reasons:
+
Data integrity::: It defines clear relationships between tables and ensures that data is accurately linked and accessible.

Efficient queries::: Understanding cardinality optimizes query execution plans. Well-defined relationships and data distribution leads to faster information retrieval and improved performance.

Database design and normalization::: Cardinality is crucial in designing databases and normalizing data. It helps reduce redundancy and optimize storage for effective organization.

Data analysis and reporting::: For businesses, cardinality enhances data analysis and reporting. It establishes meaningful relationships that provide insights into customer behavior and operational efficiency.
