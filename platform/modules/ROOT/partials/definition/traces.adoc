Traces::
A trace is a collection of operations that represents a unique transaction handled by an application and its constituent services. It is the path of a request or workflow as it progresses from one component of the system to another, capturing the entire request flow through a distributed system.
+
Traces expose the directionality and relationships between two data points, service interactions, and the effects of asynchrony. When analyzing trace data, we better understand the performance and behavior of a distributed system.

Some examples of traces include:
+
- A SQL query execution
- A function call during a user authentication request
