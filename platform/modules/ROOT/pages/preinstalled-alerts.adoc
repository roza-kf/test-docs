Kloudfuse stack comes installed with a few very useful infrastructure
(K8s and physical resource) alerts which are designed to be functional
in any k8s based environment out the box. It also has in-built alerts
which are useful for “self-monitoring” (to get notified if the Kloudfuse
stack itself is having functional issues). However, the user is required
to configure
the notifications so that they can be notified when the alert is
firing. The preinstalled alerts can be reviewed and edited from the main
alerting page.
