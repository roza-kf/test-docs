Policies are filters that determine the access that users and group have to various assets and artifacts of their organization.

Policies must have unique names.

When a user has multiple policies due to membership in multiple groups, these policy filters apply as a union (in other words, it uses the OR logical operator).

  Users who donâ€™t have an explicitly assigned policy get the default access, specified in Default Policy.

To manage policies, follow these steps:

Click the Admin tab.

Select Policy Management.

The Policy Management interface appears.
It has the following components:

Search bar to locate specific policies

List of policies, including the Policy Name, Type, and Scope.

Changing a policy
   

The Edit Policy interface appears.
You can change the Name of the policy, its Type, and its Key (the Operator / Value) tuple. 
You can build the key using logical operators, or regex expressions.
You can also delete the existing key, and add another key as a filter.
Here, we are changing the namespace_only policy by swapping the operator = (equal) to =~ (regex similar to).
